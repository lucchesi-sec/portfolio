# Cybersecurity Projects


## Overview

This section showcases my security-focused projects, demonstrating practical application of security concepts through hands-on development. These projects reflect my journey from IT administration into security, focusing on real-world tools and compliance frameworks.

## Security Assessment Tools

### [AWS Security Audit Suite](https://github.com/lucchesi-sec/aws-security-audit-suite)

AWS security scanning tool that identifies misconfigurations and compliance gaps across AWS environments. Personal project developed to address common AWS security challenges.

**Key Features:**
- Async architecture for efficient scanning
- Multi-framework compliance mapping (CIS, SOC2, NIST)
- Plugin-based architecture for extensibility
- Automated reporting and remediation suggestions

**Technical Implementation:**
- Python with Boto3 for AWS API integration
- Asynchronous scanning for performance
- JSON-based configuration system
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

**Real-World Application:**
This tool addresses common AWS security misconfigurations I've researched and encountered, providing automated detection for issues like:
- Publicly exposed S3 buckets
- Overly permissive security groups
- Unencrypted storage volumes
- Missing MFA on root accounts

### [Network Vulnerability Scanner](https://github.com/lucchesi-sec/network-vulnerability-scanner)

Comprehensive network assessment tool built with responsible disclosure practices and ethical guidelines.

**Key Features:**
- Service detection and version fingerprinting
- SSL/TLS configuration analysis
- Common vulnerability detection
- Extensible plugin architecture

**Technical Implementation:**
- Python with socket programming
- SSL certificate validation
- Multi-threaded scanning engine
- SQLite database for results storage

**Ethical Considerations:**
- Built-in rate limiting to prevent DoS
- Clear documentation on responsible use
- No exploitation capabilities
- Focus on detection and reporting

## Security Hardening & Compliance

### [Linux Server Hardening Framework](https://github.com/lucchesi-sec/linux-server-hardening)

Modular framework for automated Linux server hardening based on CIS benchmarks and security best practices.

**Key Features:**
- Automated security control implementation
- Compliance reporting
- Rollback capabilities
- Comprehensive audit logging

**Implementation Details:**
- Bash scripting for system-level changes
- Modular design for selective hardening
- Integration with configuration management tools
- Before/after state comparison

### [SSH Key Lifecycle Manager](https://github.com/lucchesi-sec/ssh-key-lifecycle-manager)

SSH key management tool addressing common key sprawl and rotation challenges. Personal project developed to solve real-world infrastructure problems.

**Key Features:**
- Automated key rotation schedules
- Comprehensive backup mechanisms
- Audit logging for compliance
- Integration with existing infrastructure

**Problem Solved:**
In my experience managing enterprise environments, SSH key management is often overlooked. This tool addresses:
- Orphaned keys from departed employees
- Lack of key rotation policies
- Missing audit trails for key usage
- Manual key distribution challenges

## Security Analysis & Research

### [Malware Analysis Toolkit](https://github.com/lucchesi-sec/malware-analysis-toolkit)

Educational static malware analysis tool for learning and research purposes.

**Key Features:**
- Static malware analysis capabilities
- PE header analysis
- String extraction and analysis
- Comprehensive safety protocols

**Safety Measures:**
- Sandbox-only execution warnings
- No dynamic analysis capabilities
- Educational disclaimers throughout
- Focus on static analysis techniques

### [Password Strength Validator](https://github.com/lucchesi-sec/password-strength-validator)

Advanced password analysis tool implementing NIST SP 800-63B guidelines.

**Key Features:**
- Entropy calculation
- Pattern detection
- Dictionary attack resistance testing
- Compliance reporting

**Technical Approach:**
- Implements latest NIST password guidelines
- Provides actionable feedback to users
- Integrates with password policies
- Educational component for security awareness

## Incident Response & Orchestration

### [Incident Response Orchestrator](https://github.com/lucchesi-sec/incident-response-orchestrator)

Automation platform for security incident response based on NIST and SANS frameworks.

**Key Features:**
- Automated triage workflows
- SIEM integration capabilities
- Compliance reporting
- Threat intelligence correlation

**Framework Implementation:**
- NIST incident response lifecycle
- SANS incident handling steps
- Customizable playbooks
- Integration with ticketing systems


## Learning & Development Approach

These projects represent my practical approach to learning security:

1. **Identify Real Problems**: Each project addresses security challenges I've encountered or researched
2. **Research Best Practices**: Implementation following industry standards (NIST, CIS, OWASP guidelines)
3. **Build Practical Solutions**: Focus on tools that solve real-world problems
4. **Document Thoroughly**: Comprehensive documentation for learning and sharing
5. **Ethical Considerations**: All tools built with responsible disclosure and ethical use in mind

## Future Development

I'm continuously expanding these projects based on:
- Emerging threats and vulnerabilities
- New compliance requirements
- Feedback from the security community
- Personal learning objectives
