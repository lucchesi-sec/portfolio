## System Administration Automation

### [SSH Key Lifecycle Manager](https://github.com/lucchesi-sec/ssh-key-lifecycle-manager)

Personal project addressing common SSH key management challenges, developed from real-world pain points experienced in enterprise environments.

**Problem Solved:**
During my time at Cox Automotive, manual SSH key rotation was a time-consuming and error-prone process. This tool automates the entire lifecycle while maintaining security.

**Design Benefits:**
- Automates key rotation to save significant time
- Designed for zero service interruptions during rotation
- Complete audit trail for compliance
- Proactive approach to prevent security incidents from stale keys

### [Linux Automation Scripts](https://github.com/lucchesi-sec/linux-automation)

Collection of practical Linux automation scripts developed for real-world use cases.

**Includes:**
- System health monitoring
- Log rotation and archival
- Service availability checks
- Automated troubleshooting scripts

## Integration & Workflow Automation

### Zapier & OCR Implementations

At Cox Automotive, I implemented several automation workflows that significantly improved operational efficiency:

**Invoice Processing Automation:**
- Integrated Nanonets OCR with accounting systems
- Designed to significantly reduce manual data entry
- Automated validation and approval workflows
- Slack notifications for exceptions

**Cross-Platform Integrations:**
- SharePoint to Slack notifications
- Automated report generation and distribution
- Email to ticket conversion systems
- Cloud storage synchronization

## Automation Philosophy

My approach to automation focuses on:

1. **Identifying Pain Points**: Start with real problems that waste time or introduce errors
2. **Incremental Implementation**: Build MVPs and iterate based on feedback
3. **Robust Error Handling**: Anticipate failures and build in recovery mechanisms
4. **Documentation First**: Ensure solutions are maintainable by others
5. **Measurable Impact**: Track time saved and errors prevented

## Technologies & Tools

### Scripting Languages
- **PowerShell**: Enterprise Windows automation, AD management, system administration
- **Python**: Cross-platform tools, API integrations, data processing
- **Bash**: Linux automation, system maintenance, deployment scripts
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe automation tools, MCP servers, API development

### Automation Platforms
